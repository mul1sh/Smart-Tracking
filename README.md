# Smart Asset Tracking

Smart Asset Tracking or SAT for short is a mobile/web app that allows companies, startups and organizations, both big and small, to easily track and dispose all their company assets without the hassle of maintaining complex paper ledgers for accounting purposes.

It also allows companies to acquire new assets from other companies in the platform either through a direct trade-off or through a normal purchase that takes into consideration the condition of the assets, depreciation rate, current market value and the estimated future disposal value of the asset. This in turn makes it much easier for companies to focus on their core business without having to worry about the daily adminstration of their physical assets.
